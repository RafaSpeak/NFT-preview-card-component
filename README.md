## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

These two blocks of code are responsible for styling components within an NFT card, creating an interactive and visually organized interface.

.nft-card .image-link:

Defines that the image link element has relative positioning and displays its content in a flexbox layout. This is important to control the layout of the image and ensure that other elements within the image, such as icons or hover effects, are positioned correctly.
.nft-card .info .days-left::before:

Creates a pseudo-element before the content that displays a clock icon (imported via an image). This icon is displayed inline, next to the "days-left" text, providing a visual cue of the remaining time.
The use of ::before allows the addition of an icon without needing an extra HTML element.
Relation:
Both blocks work to style different parts of the NFT card: the first organizes the layout of the main image, while the second adds a decorative icon before the text, creating a more user-friendly and intuitive interface.


```css

.nft-card .image-link {
    position: relative;
    display: flex;
}


.nft-card .info .days-left::before{
    content: '';
    background-image: url(../images/icon-clock.svg);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center;
    width: 15px;
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 5px;
}
```
